# Hi, I'm Mukesh!
I'm a +2 High school student with physics and Computer science as major subjects.
I'm passionate about robotics and AI. 
I'm currently building my first AI assistant "Jarvis" that works with voice and mobile features and have the ability to control real time hardwares and interact with users in real-time.
I know a bit of C and C++ OOPs, and I'm learning web development and automation.
I'm working toward becoming a Robotics Engineer .
